## Examples

The [systemjs-examples repo](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs-examples) contains a variety of examples demonstrating how to use SystemJS.

## Performance

SystemJS is designed for production modules performance and can load multiple modules in less than a millisecond. Its performance is only around a factor of 1.5 times the performance of native ES modules, as seen in the following performance benchmark, which was run by loading 426 javascript modules (all of `@babel/core`) on a Macbook pro with fast wifi internet connection. Each test was the average of five page loads in Chrome 80.

| Tool | Uncached | Cached |
| ---- | -------- | ------ |
| Native modules | 1668ms | 49ms |
| SystemJS | 2334ms | 81ms |
| es-module-shims | 2671ms | 602ms |

> [ES module Shims](https://github.com/guybedford/es-module-shims), like SystemJS, provides workflows for import maps and other modules features, but on top of base-level modules support in browsers. The performance difference is because source rewriting happens in browser instead of ahead-of-time like SystemJS handles via the System module format.

## Overview

[Introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AmdKF2UhFzw)

SystemJS provides two hookable base builds:

#### 1. s.js minimal loader

The minimal [2.3KB s.js loader](dist/s.min.js) provides a workflow where code written for production workflows of native ES modules in browsers ([like Rollup code-splitting builds](https://rollupjs.org/guide/en#code-splitting)), can be transpiled to the [System.register module format](docs/system-register.md) to work in older browsers that don't support native modules, including IE11++.

Since the ES module semantics such as live bindings, circular references, contextual metadata, dynamic import and top-level await [can all be fully supported this way](docs/system-register.md#semantics), while supporting CSP and cross-origin support, this workflow can be relied upon as a polyfill-like path.

* Support for loading [bare specifier names](docs/import-maps.md) through import maps (formerly package maps, formerly map configuration), loaded via `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` (requires a `fetch` polyfill for eg IE11).
* Loads and resolves modules as URLs, throwing for bare specifier names (eg `import 'lodash'`) like the native module loader.
* Loads System.register modules.
* Core hookable extensible loader supporting [custom extensions](docs/hooks.md).

#### 2. system.js loader

The [3.7KB system.js loader](dist/system.min.js) loader builds on the s.js core and adds support for [global loading](#extras), [non-javascript module](/docs/module-types.md), and the [SystemJS registry API](/docs/api.md#registry).

* Support for loading [bare specifier names](docs/import-maps.md) through import maps (formerly package maps, formerly map configuration), loaded via `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` (requires a `fetch` polyfill for eg IE11).
* Includes the [global loading extra](#extras) for loading global scripts, useful for loading library dependencies traditionally loaded with script tags.
* [Tracing hooks](docs/hooks.md#trace-hooks) and [registry deletion API](docs/api.md#registry) for reloading workflows.
* Supports loading Wasm, CSS and JSON [module types](docs/module-types.md).

#### 3. system-node.cjs loader

The [system-node.cjs](/dist/system-node.cjs) loader is a version of SystemJS build designed to run in Node.js, typically for workflows where System modules need to be executed on the server like SSR. It has the following features:

* Loading System modules from disk (via `file://` urls).
* Loading System modules from network (via `http://` urls), with included caching that respects the Content-Type header.
* Loading global modules with the included [global loading extra](#extras)
* Supports loading Wasm, CSS and JSON [module types](docs/module-types.md).
* Import Maps (via the `applyImportMap` api).
* [Tracing hooks](docs/hooks.md#trace-hooks) and [registry deletion API](docs/api.md#registry) for reloading workflows.

_Loading CommonJS modules is not currently supported in this loader and likely won't be. If you find you need them it is more advisable to use [Node.js native module support](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest/docs/api/esm.html) where possible instead of the SystemJS Node.js loader._

#### Extras

The following [pluggable extras](dist/extras) can be dropped in with either the s.js or system.js loader:

* [AMD loading](dist/extras/amd.js) support (through `Window.define` which is created).
* [Named exports](dist/extras/named-exports.js) convenience extension support for global and AMD module formats (`import { x } from './global.js'` instead of `import G from './global.js'; G.x`)
* [Named register](dist/extras/named-register.js) supports `System.register('name', ...)` named bundles which can then be imported as `System.import('name')` (as well as AMD named define support)
* [Transform loader](dist/extras/transform.js) support, using fetch and eval, supporting a hookable `loader.transform`
* [Dynamic import maps](dist/extras/dynamic-import-maps.js) support. This is currently a _potential_ new standard [feature](https://github.com/guybedford/import-maps-extensions#lazy-loading-of-import-maps).

The following extras are included in system.js loader by default, and can be added to the s.js loader for a smaller tailored footprint:

* [Global loading](dist/extras/global.js) support for loading global scripts and detecting the defined global as the default export. Useful for loading common library scripts from CDN like `System.import('//unpkg.com/lodash')`.
* [Module Types](dist/extras/module-types.js) `.css`, `.wasm`, `.json` [module type](docs/module-types.md) loading support in line with the existing modules specifications.

Since all loader features are hookable, custom extensions can be easily made following the same approach as the bundled extras. See the [hooks documentation](docs/hooks.md) for more information.

## Installation

```
npm install systemjs
```

## Documentation

* [Import Maps](docs/import-maps.md)
* [API](docs/api.md)
* [System.register](docs/system-register.md)
* [Loader Hooks](docs/hooks.md)
* [Module Types](docs/module-types.md)

## Example Usage

### Loading a System.register module
You can load [System.register](/docs/system-register.md) modules with a script element in your HTML:

```html
<script src="system.js"></script>
<script>System.import('/js/main.js')</script>
<script>System.import('name-of-module')</script>
```

### Loading with System.import
You can also dynamically load modules at any time with `System.import()`:

```js
System.import('/js/main.js');
```

where `main.js` is a module available in the System.register module format.

### Bundling workflow

For an example of a bundling workflow, see the Rollup Code Splitting starter project - https://github.com/rollup/rollup-starter-code-splitting.

Note that when building System modules you typically want to ensure anonymous System.register statements like:

```js
System.register([], function () { ... });
```

are emitted, as these can be loaded in a way that behaves the same as normal ES modules, and **not** named register statements like:

```js
System.register('name', [], function () { ... });
```

While these can be supported with the named register extension, this approach is typically not recommended for modern modules workflows.

### Import Maps

Say `main.js` depends on loading `'lodash'`, then we can define an import map:

```html
<script src="system.js"></script>
<script type="systemjs-importmap">
{
  "imports": {
    "lodash": "https://unpkg.com/lodash@4.17.10/lodash.js"
  }
}
</script>
<!-- Alternatively:
<script type="systemjs-importmap" src="path/to/map.json" crossorigin="anonymous">
-->
<script>
  System.import('/js/main.js');
</script>
```

#### IE11 Note for External Maps

When using external import maps (those with `src=""` attributes), there is an IE11-specific workaround that might need to be used. Browsers should not make a network request when they see `<script type="systemjs-importmap" src="/importmap.json"></script>` during parsing of the initial HTML page. However, IE11 does so. [Codesandbox demonstration](https://codesandbox.io/s/vibrant-black-xiok4?file=/index.html)

Normally this is not an issue, as SystemJS will make an additional request via fetch/xhr for the import map. However, a problem can occur when the file is cached after the first request, since the first request caused by IE11 does not send the Origin request header by default. If the request requires CORS, the lack of an Origin request header causes many web servers (including AWS Cloudfront) to omit the response CORS headers. This can result in the resource being cached without CORS headers, which causes the later SystemJS fetch() to fail because of CORS checks.

This can be worked around by adding `crossorigin="anonymous"` as an attribute to the `<script type="systemjs-importmap">` script.

* [systemjs-css-extra](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs-css-extra) CSS loader plugin

## Compatibility with Webpack

Code-splitting builds on top of native ES modules, like Rollup offers, are an alternative to the Webpack-style chunking approach - offering a way to utilize the native module loader for loading shared and dynamic chunks instead of using a custom registry and loader as Webpack bundles include. Scope-level optimizations can be performed on ES modules when they are combined, while ensuring no duplicate code is loaded through dynamic loading and code-sharing in the module registry, using the features of the native module loader and its dynamic runtime nature.

[systemjs-webpack-interop](https://github.com/joeldenning/systemjs-webpack-interop) is a community-maintained npm library that might help you get webpack and systemjs working well together.

As of webpack@4.30.0, it is now possible to compile webpack bundles to System.register format, by modifying your webpack config:

```js
{
  output: {
    libraryTarget: 'system', 
  }
}
```

If building code using the `System` global in Webpack, the following config is needed to avoid rewriting:

```js
{
  module: {
    rules: [
      { parser: { system: false } }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Using npm packages

Third party libraries and npm packages may be used as long as they are published in [a supported module format](https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/blob/master/docs/module-types.md). For packages that do not exist in a supported module format, [here is a list of github repos](https://github.com/esm-bundle/) that publish `System.register` versions of popular third party libraries (such as react, react-dom, rxjs, etc).

## Polyfills for Older Browsers

### Promises

Both builds of SystemJS need Promises in the environment to work, which aren't supported in older browsers like IE11.

Promises can be conditionally polyfilled using, for example, [Bluebird](http://bluebirdjs.com/docs/getting-started.html) (generally the fastest Promise polyfill):

```html
<script>
  if (typeof Promise === 'undefined')
    document.write('<script src="node_modules/bluebird/js/browser/bluebird.core.js"><\/script>');
</script>
```

> Generally `document.write` is not recommended when writing web applications, but for this use case
  it works really well and will only apply in older browsers anyway.

### Fetch

To support import maps in the system.js build, a fetch polyfill is need. The [GitHub polyfill](https://github.github.io/fetch/) is recommended:

```html
<script>
  if (typeof fetch === 'undefined')
    document.write('<script src="node_modules/whatwg-fetch/fetch.js"><\/script>');
</script>
```

### Constructable Stylesheets

If using CSS modules, a Constructable Stylesheets polyfill is needed - [see the module types documentation](docs/module-types.md#constructable-style-sheets-polyfill) for further info.
